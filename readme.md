# She's Gotta Develop It: Log

This is a log where I track my development activities. It is a nice way to revisit notes for projects, especially after long periods of inactivity. It's just also helpful for me to document things while learning. 

I've used this style of tracking before, with my [static site generator exercise](https://github.com/shesgottadevelopit/sans-static).

The actual log can be found [here in `log.md`](log.md).
